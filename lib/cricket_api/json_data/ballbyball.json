            "post_text": "<p>\n<b>10.00 pm</B> So that's the end. India take the trophy and hands it over to his boys. Thank you for tuning in on ESPNcricinfo. It's bee a pleasure listening to your opinions and enjoying your jokes and of course your digs when the comments aren't published. Hopefully you stick around when the T20 series begins on Republic Day, January 26 in Kanpur. For now, this is Alagappan Muthu signing off. \n</p>\n<p>\n\"Definitely, its bee a series of positives even today, 173 for 5, two youngsters step up almost get us through the line, fighting back against good quality fast bowlers. It was a great demo for the Champions Trophy,\"<b>Virat Kohli says</b>, \"Jadhav is brilliant find for us. We've backed him over the last year, he hasn't had many games, but he is coming into his own, he gives Yuvi and Dhoni the chance ot bat higher and he reads the game well, its priceless and Hardik is coming into his own as allrounder as well. The moment I saw the pitch I thought it was the perfect scenario for the Champions Trophy. The batsman had to show character and getting as close as five runs gives us a lot of confidence. The key for us will be the lengths we bowl. We've been playing at home for a while. Even here we weren't sure. That's one area we would look to address, what are the areas we need to hit to get batsmen out.\" \n</p>\n<p>\n\"Finally, it;s been hard work in a very competitive series. Today we were rewarded for our persistent drive to win,\" <b>Eoin Morgan says</b>, \"They did, it was similar to an English wicket and when you lose the toss, you have to do it the hard way and the dew was very tough to deal with. Jason Roy and Sam Billings did well at the top of the order for us. The bowlers make the captain look good. Giving a wicket that offered more helped them and actually rewarded them for good, discipline line and length. We were always open to what we wanted to do. The bowler has his options as well. The first couple of balls went for six and four, but his third and fourth deliveries were on the money and like I said, we did it the hard way. I think because there was bounce and carry, when you hit a good length, there was something on offer. So we encouraged them to hit the wicket hard and try and extract anything in there. Huge positives. India outplayed us in the first two games but this win was important. You can try hard but without wins it damages the team's confidence\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Kedar Jadhav is the Man of the Series</b> for his 232 runs in three matches. \"I was planning to play all six balls, I knew if I could do that the bowler will be under pressure. Just that the ball I got out to, I was not in position to hit the big shot, I was still moving and that is why I mistimed,\" he says, \"The thing is, since the time I came in the team, I've been spending a lot of time with Dhoni and it has helped me deal with situations calmly. Specially if you pitch it up there was some movement and that is why I didn't want to come forward, I wanted to stay back and with the dew, I knew normal shots will get me boundaries. First game when I was in the middle, with Virat, this is the time where you can learn how to finish games and that is what I told Hardik as well. If we play to our potential through the end, we would win. I was more happy if we would have won this game but I am satisfied with what I have done in this series. I can still improve\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Ben Stokes is the Man of the Match</b> for his 57 off 39 and 3 for 63 in his 50th ODI. \"It was a difficult time last time we came here, put it down to good captaincy from Morgan getting my overs out of the way before the end. Billings' has got a safe pair of hands, and most people have them. Always backing him to catch that,\" he says, \"It was difficult to start, the ball was not necessarily going through the top, but it was going a bit. Just want to start well and capitalise, Woakesy played a good hand as well. There's always dew here, it's tough for the bowlers to hit their straps. We've waited a long time to win on this tour, think we forgot to be honest. it's been fantastic to be part of three really tight games and thankfully we ended up with a win for England\"\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>9.40 pm</b> What a game. Went down to the last ball, and though there were over 600 runs made in the day, the bowlers were in with a shout as well. The new ball decked around. Even the old one did as the Eden Gardens pitch offered pace, bounce and sideways movement. You'd think this would be good practice for both teams for the Champions Trophy in the UK, but then again ODIs there tend to be played on flat decks. Not the green meanies seen in the Tests. Anyway, England's victory - much of it at least - has to be down to the Stokes effect. Hit a composed half-century in the first innings to push the total above par and then his bowling in the death provided the wickets (3-63) at the right time. Moeen's tight overs in the middle helped, especially with David Willey hurting his bowling shoulder and going off the field after only two overs. Good show all around form England. \n</p>\n<p>\nFor India, it was the Kedar Jadhav show, coming in at the halfway stage and staying on until the very last over, playing some outrageous shots. But above that, it was his ability to keep his head under pressure during his 90 off 75 balls that impressed. At one point he was picking boundaries for fun, with England digging it in at him repeatedly. Eventually they changed their plans, held their nerve, made it hard on Jadhav and dismissed him. So it ends <b><a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=runs;qualmax1=3;qualval1=matches;template=results;type=aggregate;view=series\" target=\"_blank\">after 2090 runs - the most in a series of three or fewer ODI history</a></b>\n</p>\n<p>\n\"No idea, going for six and four in the first two deliveries. Nice to close it off. The lads bowled really good overs before I came on. Suppose you're bowling to a guy who hasn't bowled a ball, you hope he didn't get a hold of it. it was damp, spikes are full of mud, bit slippery at the crease. Tough conditions, good to get the win against a tough Indian side in front of this crowd. It was nice to bowl on, thie pitch but at the same time you miss your length you get hit for four,\" <b>Woakes says</b> It's something we struggled to do, picking wickets consistently through the middle. Good to close out with a win. My first time here, beautiful ground. We'd have liked to have won the series, but credit to the Indians who have played some really good cricket\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJez: \"Wow, what a series!! When's the 4th game??\"\n</p>\n<p>\nJon: \"\"A wretched series\"? Disappointing yes, but England have played well in all three matches. India have only been slightly the better side.\" Only meant to say that England were close in all three matches and if a few things had gone their way, they would have been winning 3-0. Sometimes coming close and losing chafes all the more. But you're right. Maybe wretched was the wrong word\n</p>\n<p>\nAsjad: \"Irony is that England won that match in which they scored their lowest total of d series\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAlok Dhuri: \"Morgan kept his nerves and made crucial bowling and fielding changes..Great Captaincy\"\n</p>\n<p>\nRishav: \"Its a shame that Kedhar Jadhav is not in t20 squad. Not too late, he should be added in the squad right now.\"\n</p>",
