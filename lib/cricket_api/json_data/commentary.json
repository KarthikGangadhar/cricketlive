He&apos;ll like these conditions. So too the slight of two slips to aim at\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.25pm</b> The teams line up for the national anthems, walking out as Sunil Gavaskar rings the bell at the ground and a giant one it is too. \n</p>\n<p>\n&quot;Being part of KKR in the past, Morgan should know this pitch and ts behaviour pretty well. He may also know that Bhuvi can get good purchase on this pitch. Let us see what he &amp; his boys do, this afternoon.&quot; True, Jose... P, but from memory, the Knight Riders hardly played on a pitch that even remotely had any grass on it considering the strength of their spinners.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor more Eden nostalgia, it&apos;s 30 years since Australia became world champions for the first time. The 1987 team was commemorated a world away in Sydney but it was here that their legend was born. Daniel Brettig , with help from Tom Moody. \n</p>\n<p>\n&quot;Solving a 4th order nonlinear differential equation is easier than figuring out what comment you will publish!!! Can a man get a break?!&quot; There you go, Satya Narimetla. No go back to your scary math. \n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.10 pm</b> Considering India are bowling, it appears a good time to tune in to  ahead of the game, when he said India have planned for this series with 350 as the par score. From the opposite came, here is Jason Roy, who has  by getting set and then getting out but is excited to see Sam Billings -  - back in the XI. \n</p>\n<p>\nSoham Basak: &quot;The 2 injuries for England could arguably make their batting stronger. Talk about batting strength!&quot; A couple of milestones for England. This is Eoin Morgan&apos;s 150th ODI, while Ben Stokes is playing his 50th,  where his spirit was broken,  by Andrew Miller if anyone cares for a refresher. \n</p>\n<p>\nRameshwar: &quot;Why only Dhavan got axed today. Similar treatment should be with Rahul also. He also did not perform in last 2 ODIs.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\nSujaishil: &quot;Really Rameshwar? Dhawan has got plenty of chances already. Rahul is just in his initial phase of limited overs career. And Rahane should have been in 11 in first place never understood his omission&quot; . \n</p>\n<p>\nOm Pashupati: &quot;Awaiting the start of India last ODI here in Sweden. Cricket is generally not a very popular sport here But, my regular glueing to cricnfo during this series has generated quite a few interest towrds the game among my swedish friends here !&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.00 pm India have won the toss and will bowl</b> &quot;Pretty decent surface,&quot; says Virat Kohli. &quot;Won&apos;t change too much. It&apos;s always been a good chasing ground, quick outfield, ball travels in the air quickly and the dew as well. There&apos;s nothing like keeping winning games. Its important to create good habits and sustain them. It&apos;s about being ruthless. There has been dew, not too early in the evening, but dew is a massive factor in the last 15 overs. That means you can get settled. Just one change, <b>Rahane in for Dhawan</b>. It doesn&apos;t seem like India&apos;s change has come out of injury. \n</p>\n<p>\n&quot;Most grass I&apos;ve seen on a Kolkata wicket,&quot; says Eoin Morgan, &quot;We&apos;ve been very competitive, lot of strong points from the two games before. Our batters have performed really well but our bowlers haven&apos;t quite hit their straps. Haven&apos;t played a complete game yet. Scoring 350 as a side in the first two games puts the batsmen in a good space. Two changes. Two injuries. <b>Root has a niggle</b> along with Hales&apos; fractured hand. <b>Sam Billings and Jonny Bairstow come in</b>&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\nVinod Rajpal: &quot;England have lost all the 3 ODIs they have played at Eden Gardens , twice with India in 2007 &amp; 2011, once with Aus in World Cup Final 1987&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\nanees zed: &quot;&quot; ...It&apos;s always been a good chasing ground...&quot; always? Not quite sure when I think about India chasing a modest total in that (in)famous 96 WC SF against SL.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>12.55 pm</b> &quot;There&apos;s a fair sprinkling of grass,&quot; says Sunil Gavaskar about the pitch in Kolkata. Now with the sun around, it might not come into play, but in the evening, the seam bowlers might have a bit of fun. You probably have to weigh that in with the dew factor, which is settling in around 5.30 - 6.00 pm. India&apos;s final ODI before the Champions Trophy in June is coming up. \n</p>\n<p>\nRAV-QAT: &quot;What is changed in cricket, I see so many scores of 300+ since last world cup? I thought the use 2 new ball will help the bowlers but they are battered often.&quot; But as it turns out, it has only helped the batsmen because they can count on the hardness staying on for longer. And on a flat pitch, even with fielders on the boundary, even with five of them there in the last 10 overs, batsmen can easily rack it up. In fact, England&apos;s 366 in the last game in Cuttack became the . ESPNcricinfo&apos;s stats editor S Rajesh looks at that and more. \n</p>\n<p>\n<b>12.50 pm</b> The toss at Eden Gardens is coming up in 10 minutes. But elsewhere, the Australian Open continues in Melbourne, with Roger Federer, Andy Murray, Angelique Kerber, Stan Wawrinka and many more in action on Day 7. You can watch it all <b></b>. \n</p>\n<p>\nAnurag: &quot;Andy Murray out of Aus Open. Only Federer and Wawrinka left as obstacles for Nadal. #hopes&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n&quot;Awaiting the start of 3rd ODI. 2:12 AM here in Boston but the match is worth the wait!&quot; yelps Sanket Kumar, &quot;Should India try Rahane today instead of Dhawan/Rahul?&quot; I have no idea whatsoever but Vishal chimes in with this: &quot;Dhawan was the first to hit the nets from India, so looks like he will keep his place. Bowlers also warming up at the square - Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar, Ashwin and Jadeja. And Woakes and Willey on the other side.&quot; \n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nHarsh: &quot;That  will give me nightmares for days to come. I hope the epidemic does not spread to Kolkata.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>12.45 pm</b> Vishal Dikshit is enjoying life in Kolkata. And more importantly he has good news for those who prefer a slightly more even contest between bat and ball. &quot;Beautiful day here - bright and sunny right now, gets breezy in the evening, making it a perfect Sunday for the locals. The ground is only starting to fill up. The quick bowlers will be hoping for a better day; the pitch could assist seamers early on, the ground is big (although with a quick outfield) and they&apos;ll hope the pitch is not as flat as the others.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\nInitial reading of how the teams may stack up. &quot;Looks like England will make more changes than India today,&quot; says Vishal, &quot;Billings is taking throw downs to take Hales&apos; place [fractured hand], Jonny Bairstow was padded up early and had a look at the pitch, Liam Dawson was hanging around too. &quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>12.35 pm</b> Runs, runs and more runs. There&apos;s been two matches, they&apos;ve yielded a grand sum of 1453 and while the bowlers cringe and hide,  is waving a bright, flashy chequered flag for both teams and, of course, Eden Gardens. This series is only 439 runs away from becoming the most productive one of three matches or less in the history of ODI cricket. \n</p>\n<p>\nHello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo&apos;s live coverage of the third ODI between India and England. The hosts have won the series, and despite the margins being slim on the face of it, they have been emphatic victories indeed. Eoin Morgan though has said his men haven&apos;t quite put their best foot forward yet. .
